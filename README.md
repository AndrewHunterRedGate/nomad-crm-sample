Nomad CRM Sample
==============

What is this?
--------
This is the result of a few engineers from [Red Gate](http://www.red-gate.com/our-company/about/) working on building a sample application for [Nomad for Visual Studio](http://vsnomad.com) using JQuery Mobile and Knockout.js.

You can read about how we built the application on our [blog](http://vsnomad.com/tag/dtw-crm-sample/) and why we made some of the decisions that we did.

Using the sample
--------

To make it easy to get started, we are hosting a running instance of the ASP.NET projects on Azure for you that so once you open the solution you can immediately start debugging the Nomad project without needing to deploy any of the ASP.NET components. 

If you want to run the ASP.NET projects locally, then you will need to edit CrmContext.cs to provide a valid SqlConnection.
